Acknowledgement
* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.


Reason: Acquired bigger EC2 instances on-demand. That fives us the flexibility to change them in future.
